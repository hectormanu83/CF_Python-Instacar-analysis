# CF_Python-Instacar-Project

## An exploratory analysis of some Instacart data to derive insights and strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

#### For a project for an existing company, Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has outstanding sales but wants to uncover more information about its sales patterns. My task was to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.
